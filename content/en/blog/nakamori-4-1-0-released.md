We are excited to announce that the latest version of Nakamori is now available for download, after undergoing many
months of internal and public testing. This update is one of the most significant to date, as Nakamori has been entirely
rewritten from the ground up to shift to Python 3 with Kodi 19.

However, due to the Kodi dev team's decision, **Nakamori is no longer backwards compatible** with older versions of Kodi.
Therefore, if you are using an older version of Kodi, please do not upgrade Nakamori until you have upgraded to Kodi 19.

As a result of this complete rewrite, the Nakamori dev team has decided to implement only essential features and will
evaluate requests for new or returning features. You can make a request on the
[Nakamori Gituhb](https://github.com/bigretromike/nakamori) if there is something you would like to see added or
brought back.

As with any major release, unforeseen issues are expected. Therefore, please make sure to report any issues you
encounter on the Nakamori repo, so the Nakamori dev team can fix them promptly.
