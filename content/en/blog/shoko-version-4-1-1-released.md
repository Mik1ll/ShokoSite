This maintenance release addresses a few reported bugs and a few under-the-hood changes that won't affect most users. However, its main purpose is it allows Shoko Server to work with our latest media player plugin, [Shokofin](https://shokoanime.com/blog/tag/shokofin/). Read the announcement blog post about [Shokofin](https://shokoanime.com/blog/hello-shokofin/) if you'd like to learn more. 

For a complete list of changes, check out the [Changelog](https://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog/).

We also figured this blog post would be a good time to update everyone on the status of our in-development projects. 

##### Ashen 

Ashen is on hold at the moment as **Da3dsoul** is working on other projects. We previously pulled some users and had them test out the service and for the most part it worked flawlessly. However this is still a lot of work that needs to be done on Ashen itself and as well as Shoko before you'll be able to use it. We're looking at a beta release sometime around Q3 of 2022.

##### Shoko Web UI 

Our team has been busy working on refining the designs and we're hoping for an **MVP** (minimum viable product) release by this holiday. We'll also be running multiple closed beta tests as each section is completed which should tremendously help iron out bugs and unforeseen issues.
