This small maintenance release addresses a bug introduced in version 4.0.0 that caused imported files to automatically be renamed regardless of user preference. As this was an unscheduled release, expect another maintenance update in the next week or so to address a few minor bugs such as Plex linking inconsistencies and TVDB cache related issues. 

For a complete list of changes, check out the [Changelog](https://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog).

##### Fixing Renamed Files

For users affected by this bug, we've created a renamer plugin to restore your filenames. Place the file below into the **plugins** folder located in your Shoko Server install.

Please note, You'll need to use **Shoko Desktop** to select both the plugin and the affected files.

##### Shoko Docs Major Update In The Works

We're currently working on a major rewrite to Shoko Docs, so it matches the current version of Shoko. We're asking for feedback on what you'd like to see covered, so we can prioritize what pages to write first. Additionally, anyone willing to help improve Shoko Docs should contact **Elemental Crisis** on Discord.  

While the following is still a work in progress, here's a sneak peak.
