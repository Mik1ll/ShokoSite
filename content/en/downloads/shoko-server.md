### Automation Done Right { class="downloads-single-content-first" }

Manually manging your anime collection is hard work, tedious and extremely boring and frankly who has the time for  that? With Shoko, regain your precious time back and instead spend it on debating on which series in your backlog you might watch before eventually deciding on watching a series you've already watched. We designed Shoko to be **incredibly easy** to install and takes less than **five minutes** to get it setup, running and cataloging your anime collection.

##### Lets Get Technical

Shoko employs what is known as a **client-server architecture** allowing different programs and plugins access to Shoko, even if they are not on the same PC or network. Using the built-in Web UI, users can even remotely manage and configure Shoko Server without ever having to physically access the computer Shoko is on. 

##### How Does The Magic Work?

Shoko **hashes each file in your collection** and then compares the hash against AniDB's vast hash database to find a match. One a match is found, Shoko creates the series and starts populating your database with general information about the series including episode related information, character information, related series as well as user recommended series. Shoko also pulls series information from the various community sites you've enabled giving you even more details and making your collection that much better. 

For installation help please use the links listed on the **right** under **resources**.
