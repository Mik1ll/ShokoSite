Rename your files with Lua. Fitting for those who have renaming requirements not fulfilled by the legacy renamer and don't want to write+compile their own plugin. Provides access to much of the data available via Shoko's plugin interface, allowing you to write a script with complex renaming rules and edge case handling. Also allows you to fully control where your files end up with destination import folder and subfolder customization.
