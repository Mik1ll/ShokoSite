Ideal for users with specific renaming needs not met by the legacy renamer, Lua allows you to rename files without
writing and compiling your own plugin. Access extensive data via Shoko's plugin interface to create scripts with complex
renaming rules and edge case handling. Additionally, you can fully control the destination import folder and subfolder
customization, ensuring your files are organized exactly as you want.

New users, we highly recommend reading the **Getting Started** docs, which will guide you through creating your first
script. Check the links at the top of the page to get started.

**Requires minimal coding knowledge to use.**
