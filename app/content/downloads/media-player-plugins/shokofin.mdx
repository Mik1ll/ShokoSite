Plex is great, but sometimes you want something different, and that's where Jellyfin comes in. Combining Jellyfin's
versatility with Shoko's automation lets you watch your anime collection from any Jellyfin-supported device. Shokofin
syncs your watched state data back to Shoko, automatically updating your linked community sites. It also lets you group
your series using Shokoâ€™s Groups for better media display control. Whether you prefer a single library for both series
and movies or separate libraries, Shokofin offers the flexibility to customize your viewing experience.
