We've released a maintenance update for JMM, version 3.6.0.3, that fixes JMM Server and Desktop crashing that was
reported shortly after the release of 3.6.0.2. Just goes to show that even with a month-long public beta and rigorous
internal testing, all it takes is that one unique setup to present us with a bug we never encountered.
