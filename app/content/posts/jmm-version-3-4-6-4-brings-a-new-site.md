Hello Everyone,

JMM has gone through a lot of changes over the past couple of months, both with JMM itself and, as you might have
noticed, the website as well. Before I go into detail about the new website and other changes, let's talk about the new
version of JMM!

With each release, we'll cover a few of the new additions or changes, but for a complete listing, check out
the [changelog](https://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog).

##### Nakamori, the JMM Plugin for Kodi

The biggest change with Version 3.4.6.4 is the long-awaited addition of Kodi support with the Nakamori Plugin! This was
made possible by BigRetroMike, a member of our community who developed and maintains the Nakamori plugin. For
installation instructions and general Nakamori usage, check out the Nakamori documentation by clicking on Documentation
in the above menu and selecting Nakamori. BigRetroMike is always looking for feedback on how to improve Nakamori, so if
you find anything wrong with it or would like to see a feature added, head over to
the [Nakamori GitHub Repo](https://github.com/bigretromike/nakamoriplugin/issues).

##### Hashing Speed Fix

There's been a lot of discussion over the past couple of months over JMM's hashing speed. With Version 3.4.6.4, this
discussion can be put to rest as hashing speeds have been improved.

Here are some examples of the previous hashing speed.

- Hashed file in 7.1 seconds --- [DeadFish] Fairy Tail (2014) - 02 [720p][AAC] (247 MB)
- Hashed file in 46.3 seconds --- [Hatsuyuki]_Sword_Art_Online_-_Extra_Edition_[10bit][1280x720][73C2BC87] (1.53 GB)

Here are some examples of the improved hashing speed

- Hashed file in 1.3 seconds --- Haikyuu!! Second Season - 08 [02DD13E3].mkv (278 MB)
- Hashed file in 1.2 seconds --- [HorribleSubs] Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm - 04 [720p].mkv (325 MB)
- Hashed file in 6.1 seconds --- [xmbx] Gintama: Yorinuki Gintama-san on Theater 2D - Shinsengumi Douran
  Hen [DVD 480P AAC] [7H302N1D] (798 MB)
- Hashed file in 10.4 seconds --- [NoobSubs] Sword of the Stranger (720p Blu-ray 8bit AAC).mp4 (1.53 GB)

If you are still experiencing problems, please open an issue on GitHub so we can help.

##### AniDB MyList Options Update

Some new options were added to the Delete Action function under AniDB MyList Options. Double-check your settings as your
selected option might have changed. Additionally, if you hover over the drop-down box, the tooltip has been updated
explaining what each option does.

##### New Website!

Just by reading this, you can see our new website for JMM. The biggest reason for moving away from GitHub Pages to a
self-hosting solution is it allows us to have more control over the website and do what we want. WordPress (the CMS
we're using) offers us flexibility and a range of plugins to enhance your experience. If you encounter any issues or
have feedback, please let us know either on Discord or
the [Shoko Website GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ShokoAnime/ShokoSite).
