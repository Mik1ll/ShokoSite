Hello Everyone!

After seven months of development, we're close to releasing the next version of Shoko, Version 3.8! Looking back at our
past releases, this upcoming version is by far the biggest release we've done so far. However, with that being said,
Version 3.8 is not as feature-packed as one might think based on the claim I just made. Instead, the majority of the
work has been in optimizing Server and Desktop code, as these are essential to our overall goal of making Shoko Server
cross-platform and the building of the new Shoko Desktop, currently codenamed ClientV2.

Our daily users have done a lot of testing and we feel we're close to an official release which means it's time for a
public beta! As usual, head on over to our [Beta Page](https://shokoanime.com/) for the download link and to see what
known issues are present in this beta. If everything goes accordingly, we're expecting to run this beta for **one week**
and then release.

I won't be going into the changes in this post, you'll have to wait for the official release post. In the meantime,
check out the [Changelog](https://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog.html) for a complete listing of everything that's been
added, updated, fixed, and removed.
