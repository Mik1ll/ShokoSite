This release will be the last release for version 3.8 as we're starting to work on some major internal changes that we'
ve been planning for a while. There are a couple of features and issues we wanted to address for this release but were
unable to, so they will be included in the next major release which currently has no date.

For a complete list of changes, check out the [Changelog](https://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog.html).

##### Shoko Desktop 2 Preview

While pretty barebones, we wanted to give users a taste of the next version of Shoko Desktop we've been working on. Very
soon we'll be starting to talk about this new version, showcasing the changes and planned features, but for now, give it
a try yourself.

Like the WebUI, use your Shoko account to log in. At the moment, the group section is the only working section but you
can view the Series Info page on a series.

##### Shoko Docs Revamp

We've revamped Shoko Docs, cleaning up the layout and hopefully making it easier to navigate. As Shoko Docs is an
ongoing project, we'll continue to make changes as needed and add new content as time allows.
