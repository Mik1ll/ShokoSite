After a couple of weeks of testing, we're happy to announce My Anime 3.7.3 is now available for download.

This is strictly a maintenance release and  addresses some incompatibility issues when using the latest version of Shoko Server. Episode lists should now properly populate, and issues encountered during video playback have been resolved.

If you continue to encounter any of these issues or discover a new issue, please create an issue on GitHub.
