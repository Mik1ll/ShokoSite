While we continue working on the next release of Shoko (coming soon!), one of our devs has been working on a side
project for some time now and has released a public beta that we wanted to highlight. What better time than right before
we say goodbye to 2020 and hello to 2021?

## Introducing Sushi.Net, A .NET Port of Sushi

For those not familiar, [sushi](https://github.com/tp7/Sushi) is a **Python** script that allows you to remux releases
with ease regardless of the audio and/or subtitle source. Like **Shoko**, it's designed to remove the manual process and
automatically syncs up subtitles by finding similarities in audio streams.

Now thanks to **MaxPiva**, this handy utility is now available for .NET devs and once version 1.00 hits, it will be
available as a NuGet package.

## How Audio Shifting Works With Sushi.Net

Basically, Sushi.Net will normalize the destination audio stream, then find the silences in the stream, and mark the
destination stream into chunks. After that, it will apply a band filter to attenuate the vocals and load both streams
into memory. Those chunks will be matched against the source stream. Then the source stream will be reconstructed
matching the destination stream chunks positions and saved.

Of course, it can also shift subtitles in the same way the original Sushi does, and it supports multiple external
subtitles as input (space separated), or it can get the subtitles from the --src stream if it's a container (mkv, mp4,
etc).

## How To Get Started

You can download [Sushi.Net](https://github.com/maxpiva/Sushi.Net) on GitHub. You'll find instructions, examples, and
additional information in the repo.

## See You In 2021

2021 is going to be a big year for Shoko with the realization and finalization of a lot of work. We'll have a blog post
very soon to share some of these exciting details with everyone.
