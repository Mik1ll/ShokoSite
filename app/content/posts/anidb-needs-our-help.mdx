The amazing folks over at AniDB have recently announced that their hosting, which had been provided for free for many
years by a generous member, will be coming to an end soon. While the AniDB team has found a replacement host, there is
now the issue of how to pay for this hosting. AniDB has never accepted donations or placed ads on their website, always
providing their content for free. This has been great for everyone, and we've greatly benefited from it as Shoko does
not work without AniDB. This, in turn, has allowed every single one of our users to benefit from it. AniDB is the only
site that not only provides all the raw information we need but allows us to access it for free. If AniDB goes offline,
there is a high probability that Shoko will follow or be drastically reduced in what it can do. This is a simple truth
of what could happen if the main feature of Shoko, automated hashing and lookup resulting in the automatic creation of
your collection, is no longer available.

#### Without AniDB, There Is No Shoko.

We're asking everyone to read the news post linked below and consider donating when the AniDB staff opens donations to
help keep a great site and service available. For example, if 100 people were to donate, it would only require a monthly
donation of 2.51â‚¬, which is less than what most people spend on a coffee per day.

If you've benefited from Shoko, please consider helping the service that makes Shoko possible.

AniDB's Patreon is now live. For a breakdown of costs and the current donation amount, they added
