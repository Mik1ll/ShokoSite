It's been over four years since our last [major update to the Shoko website](/blog/shoko-website-updated),
where we transitioned from Jekyll to Hugo and introduced a new design. Since then, we’ve made minor cosmetic and
code adjustments, but the core of the site has remained largely unchanged. Now, we’re unveiling a completely rebuilt
Shoko website with a fresh design and improved functionality.

## From Hugo to Remix

One of the most significant changes is the switch from [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to [Remix](https://remix.run) as our
front-end framework. While Hugo served us well as a static site generator and was incredibly fast, Remix allows us to
implement server-side rendering. This transition lets us add dynamic features like real-time routing and data
fetching, which would have been more cumbersome with Hugo and client-side JavaScript. Remix better aligns with our
current needs and is easier for our team to work with.

## Dark Mode: All Day, Every Day

In the previous version, dark mode was more of an afterthought and didn’t meet our expectations. With the new site,
we’ve focused heavily on making dark mode the primary theme. In fact, it’s now the default, and we’ve decided not to
offer a light theme unless specifically requested. This shift ensures a more cohesive and intentional design
experience for dark mode users.

## New Logo

While the new logo has been live on our Discord server and the Web UI Beta for a while, it’s now officially part
of the website. The logo was the product of numerous AI-generated attempts, and we’re pleased with the final result.
It was especially important to us that the team reached a consensus on this version, as a previous commissioned
logo was never used.

A special thanks to **Queuecumbr** for refining the design, fixing imperfections, and turning it into a proper SVG file.

## Why the Switch to AI Art?

In July, we received a DMCA notice for images we had used on the site, specifically from a company representing VIZ
Media. Upon reviewing the situation, we found that VIZ Media owned the rights to several anime series we had featured.
Although we removed the requested images, we decided to be more proactive by replacing all artwork on the site with
AI-generated images. This approach helps us avoid future copyright and licensing issues.

Additionally, we’ll be blurring series posters in Shoko images, including user-submitted content, to further minimize
any potential risks. We understand that this may not be the most popular decision, but it’s the safest course of action
for the project. While we’re aware of "fair use" arguments, it’s not worth the potential legal and financial burdens.

Using AI art is a convenient solution to these issues.

## Shoko Docs Update Coming Soon

Alongside the new website, we’re also preparing a major update to the Shoko Docs site. We're moving from our custom
Hugo setup to [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build). If all goes according to plan, the updated Shoko Docs will
launch within the next week.

Here’s a sneak peek of the new design and some of the upcoming content:

## Shoko Version 5.0.0

After over a year of development, Shoko Server version 5.00 is almost ready for release. Assuming we don’t encounter
any critical bugs, we expect to launch it in the coming weeks. We’ll provide a full blog post covering all the new
features and changes once it’s officially released.
