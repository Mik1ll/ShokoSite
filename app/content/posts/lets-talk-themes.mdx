One of the oldest feature requests, going all the way back to when the program was still called JMM, was the
implementation of proper theme support for both Server and Desktop. Although it was explored, limitations related
to [WPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation) made this request near impossible and a huge
time sink for the devs.

With the announcement of Shoko Desktop 2, its change from a C# program to a web application, and the eventual decision
to merge Shoko Desktop features into the Server Web UI, theme support was once again reevaluated. We decided it would
be something added after the release of version 1.0.0, as referenced
[here](https://github.com/ShokoAnime/Shoko-WebUI/issues/112).

## Hello Theme Support

Earlier in the year, we polled users of varying Shoko experience to gather feedback on the current Web UI design,
aiming to identify user pain points and areas for improvement. Using the data we gathered, we decided to start a
complete redesign of the Web UI, internally known as V7 (Version 7), to build a better Web UI for our users. While
this process was underway, we took a look at our post-version 1.0.0 list and decided to move a couple of items up,
such as user avatar support and, of course, proper theme support.

After multiple discussions, we determined there were two major things required to have theme support within the Web
UI. The first was zero intervention from our end, meaning once implemented, we would not have to do anything for users
to add and create themes. The second was the ability to easily create themes, requiring the user to only have to change
some template wording and the HEX values themselves. As a result, theme support will be fully integrated and available
from the moment the new Web UI launches.

In fact, our beta users are already enjoying the benefits of theme support and have had the opportunity to create
their own personalized themes with minimal work. Creating a theme typically takes no more than 5 minutes, with users
only needing to look up HEX colors to get started.

To provide a glimpse of what's possible with the new theme support feature, we asked some of our beta testers to try
out the system and share screenshots of their customized dashboards.

Here are a few examples of the themes created by our beta testers. We're planning on doing more posts like this in the
future to highlight upcoming features, so keep an eye on the blog, or at least the Shoko News widget on the Dashboard.
