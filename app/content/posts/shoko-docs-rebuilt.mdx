What began as a simple effort to update the Shoko Docs evolved into a complete overhaul, resulting in a new and improved
version. Similar to our previous website, the earlier version of Shoko Docs was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
with the intention of making it easier to maintain and update. However, due to various challenges—from CSS issues to
missing features—it became clear that we didn’t have the time to manage both the site structure and the content. As a
result, documentation often took a back seat for much of the team.

Multiple documentation frameworks were considered and tested, with even one, [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build),
being used for a long time and even previewed it our [Shoko Website Rebuilt](/blog/shoko-website-rebuilt) blog post
before we decided to move to VitePress. While Starlight checked a lot of the requirements we had, it required a lot
of custom work to get it to where we wanted it to be, which would become difficult to maintain in the long run.

about the process of rebuilding the documentation and how you can help.

## Hello VitePress

To address these issues, we decided to rebuild the Shoko Docs using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev), a lightweight
documentation site generator that leverages [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). This new
version of Shoko Docs is designed to be more user-friendly, with a cleaner layout and improved navigation. Shoko Docs
now has a long-overdue integrated search bar, better mobile support, and a proper dark mode option. Since we no longer
need to worry about maintaining the site structure, we can focus on creating and updating content, ensuring that the
documentation remains up-to-date and accurate.

## Rewriting the Docs

The process of rewriting the documentation was a significant undertaking. Initially, we aimed to update the existing
content, but after migrating it, we realized much of it had become outdated. So instead, we decided it would simply be
faster and more beneficial to rewrite the entire thing. We also took the opportunity to reorganize the flow of the
documentation, making it easier to navigate and find the information you need.

## Missing Content

While we've added a ton of new content, there are still some sections that need to be rewritten which will happen over
time. We'll prioritize the most user requested sections first, so if you have any suggestions, feel free to let us know
on Discord.

## How You Can Help

If you're interested in contributing to Shoko Docs, we'd love to have you on board!

No coding experience is needed, as each page is written in Markdown, making it simple to update and maintain. You just
need to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. If you'd like to help but aren’t familiar
