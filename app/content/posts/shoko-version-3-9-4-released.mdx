Shoko Version 3.9.4 is now available for download!

This release addresses various bugs reported since the last update that we felt needed addressing before the next major
version. This version also contains a big change which we've addressed below.

For a complete list of changes, check out the [Changelog](https://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog.html).

## Shoko Analytics

One of the bigger changes we were going to introduce in version 4.0 was the inclusion of a telemetry service. However,
we didn't want it to get buried by the other features and changes coming with version 4.0, so instead, we added a basic
version of it into version 3.9.4. With telemetry services being a hot topic these days, we wanted to fully explain our
reasons for adding it and what data we'll be collecting to avoid any confusion going forward.

Shoko Server is a massive program and will only continue to grow. While we generate logs with data related to Shoko
Server's operations, these logs are only useful to us when provided by our users. Therefore, the data we'll be
collecting will allow us to target specific issues, add or update popular features, and re-tool less popular ones.
Furthermore, **all data collected is non-identifiable.** We don't care about what specific titles you have in your
collection or what you watch. We only care about making Shoko better.

Starting with Version 3.9.4, we'll be collecting information related to the following.

- AniDB - Ban Type (HTTP/UDP)
- Import - Run Import
- Import - Run Import (Scan TVDB)
- Import - Run Import (Scan MovieDB)
