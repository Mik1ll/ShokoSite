Shoko Version 3.9.7 is now available for download!

We've been hard at work on some of the items we previously mentioned
in [What's Next For Shoko](https://shokoanime.com/blog/whats-next-for-shoko/) and wanted to release this feature-packed
update as it might be a while before the next release.

This release contains many fixes and improvements to the AniDB system, TvDB System, and TvDB image downloading. We've
also tweaked the Sentry settings to stop it from spamming the logs.

The Web UI also got some much-needed TLC, and users are now able to pause, start, and cancel queues.
