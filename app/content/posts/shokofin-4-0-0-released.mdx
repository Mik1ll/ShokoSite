To the people expecting this to be just a small release to add support for **Jellyfin** 10.9; You were wrong. Sorry. üòî
Instead you'll get this feature packed release that has been accumulating over the last year. If you don't already know
what **Shokofin** is, then I'll advise you to read our [introduction post](/blog/introducing-shokofin-jellyfin-plugin),
check out [our docs](https://docs.shokoanime.com/shokofin/install/) or explore
the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ShokoAnime/Shokofin) first.

**We have a new stable plugin repository URL, so update yours if you haven't already!**

```txt
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShokoAnime/Shokofin/metadata/stable/manifest.json
```

(_The dare-devils reading this can replace `stable` with `dev` for a higher chance of breakage during updates._ üòà)

The release was delayed _a bit_ to ensure we ironed out any major bugs in the plugin while we waited for Jellyfin to
become stable _enough_ for us to proceed. This extra time has allowed us to deliver a more polished stable release
experience for all users. üôÇ

Now, let's start with the positives: we have new major features, bug fixes, Jellyfin 10.9 support, an overhauled
settings page, and other smaller changes since the last release. The best part is, we still only require the same ol' *
*Shoko Server** 4.2.2 (_or any newer daily version_). There are however some downsides: Overhauling the settings
involved breaking the settings for all existing `3.x` installs. Additionally, support for Jellyfin 10.8 _and_ TvDB IDs
on entities has been removed, and episode numbers are now relative. The last change shouldn't affect anyone negatively
unless you were using the hide episode feature _incorrectly_ in Shoko Server.

Read on if you want to know more, or dive head-first into the release. üèä

## Revamped Settings Ahead

**Your plugin settings have been revamped and thus need reconfiguration.**

In this update, we've replaced many older settings with newer counterparts and added new settings for the newly added
features. We've rewritten the _Metadata Settings_ section and the _Library Settings_ section, removed the _Tag Settings_
section, added new settings to the _User Settings_ section, a new _Media Folder Settings_, _SignalR Connection_ and
_SignalR Settings_ sections. Let's dive into the details of these changes.

The Metadata Settings section has been completely overhauled. We now have a new set of default settings with overrides
per metadata item group. The Tag section has been removed, but the overhauled tag system internals now allow more
granular control of tags, genres, content ratings, and production locations, all integrated into the metadata settings.
The latter two were just recently added, while the former two were less configurable previously. Also, shout out to *
*fearnlj01** for their great contributions by implementing the new priority-based selectors you can find if you enable
the override for a metadata item group. Without his help, we wouldn't have these new and fancy selectors that match what
you see elsewhere in the Jellyfin Web UI. üôå

Now, let's look at the changes in the Library Settings section, as it has seen significant updates as well. The
series/season merging option is gone ‚Äî replaced with a simple toggle to enable or disable Shoko Groups ‚Äî and along with
it the TvDB/TMDB compatibility mode. Movie collections based on Shoko Groups are also gone, now replaced with the option
to create collections for both movies and shows instead. Season ordering has been moved into this section, but the
_Chronological Ordering_ options are still considered **_experimental_** and should only be used if you're one of those
people that can't live without a small abundance of potential catastrophe ahead, as it's still very much in the testing
stages. In addition, we've had a slew of new options added to this section since the last stable version.

Explore on your own or ask for help in our Discord while you wait for the new settings documentation to go live
on [our site](https://docs.shokoanime.com/shokofin/configuration/). üìö

## Enter Virtual Reali‚Äì _File System_

Say hello to the new **Virtual File System** (**VFS**) üéâ, which is now enabled by default for all installs. It allows
you to disregard the underlying disk file structure while automagically meeting Jellyfin's requirements for file
organization. It also ensures that no unrecognized files appear in your library and allows us to fully leverage
Jellyfin's native features better than we otherwise could without the feature. This enables us to effortlessly support
trailers, special features, and theme videos for series, seasons _and_ movies, merge partial episodes into a single
entry, and offer better support for mixed type libraries¬π. All this is possible because we disregard the underlying disk
file structure to create our own. Additionally, the VFS can be toggled on a per media library basis, giving you
flexibility in how you manage your collections.

With the VFS now being automatically enabled for all libraries, it is recommended to recreate any existing libraries
that use Shokofin to speed up the transition to using the VFS. Otherwise Shokofin will start to migrate the existing
libraries to the VFS on the next library scan or metadata refresh. For those who wish to not use the VFS, make sure to
disable it in the plugin settings before the next scan or refresh event occurs to avoid any and/or destructive work
being done.

You _can_ achieve the same end results without the VFS layer if you build a custom renamer for Shoko Server to match the
logic we have in our VFS layer for your physical library, but that requires having **_a lot_** of domain knowledge for
how Jellyfin works, including some of its internal workings and all its expectations toward file system structures, how
AniDB structures its anime on the site, how Shoko Server operates using both the plugin API and REST APIv3, and how
Shokofin (this plugin) works internally and which settings you have configured the plugin to use. Instead of pushing all
these requirements onto _you_ as an end user or a Shoko Server plugin/renamer developer, we've taken on the burden of
managing the complexity in the plugin, allowing us to adapt the VFS layer according to the selected library type and
selected plugin settings in Jellyfin, and metadata served from Shoko Server. üöÄ

While the approach taken to implement this feature is relatively new and might still fail in a few edge cases, it has
been tested on _real libraries_ for a while now and is now considered stable enough for daily use. If you do find any
errors while using it, it is recommended to file an issue report either in our Discord server or on GitHub.

Because the VFS is automagically managed by the plugin, it should not be manually altered by the user. Any changes to
the files managed by the plugin will be wiped on refresh. Changes in Shoko, such as adjustments to series movements or
episode relocations, can trigger automatic updates in the VFS if the necessary SignalR events are enabled on the
library. The exception to this are any subtitle files and any files within the extras folders that do not contain any
Shoko IDs in their name, which can safely be added by the user and/or other plugins. We even support moving the subtitle
files placed in the VFS besides a video file into the underlying "real" library so they will persist across library
recreations! üíæ Though do note that the same cannot be said for any extras not managed by the plugin, as they're 100% out
of our control because we cannot get a good anchor point to use in the underlying "real" library.

¬π _We support it in the plugin when using the VFS, but the support for mixed libraries in the core of Jellyfin is still
flaky at best._

## Seamless Fusion of Episodes and Seasons

We now calculate episode numbers relatively, which shouldn't affect most users under normal circumstances. However, if
you're one of those people who hide episodes in Shoko for whatever reason, you'll be pleased to see a positive change in
the episode numbering in Jellyfin as this feature hides any previously existing gaps. This update also paves the way for
the newly implemented ‚Äî but still **_experimental_** ‚Äî season merging option, which allows us to blur the boundaries
between AniDB entries by merging them into a single anime entry based on name matching and a configurable merge window ‚Äî
_finally_ fixing the split for those long standing same year entries for the same series, or more! Just do keep in mind
that the implementation of this feature is still in the early stages and may need further tweaking, so for now, it‚Äôs
reserved for _the daredevils who lust after new toys to play with_ until we work out the kinks.

## Collections Stirred to Perfection

In order to create a seamless blend of different media types, we had to rethink and rework our collection support from
the ground up. Imagine making a perfect smoothie ‚Äî you need the right mix of ingredients, and sometimes, you have to
blend and adjust until everything fits just right. The last version was like forgetting to plug in the blender ‚Äî it
wasn‚Äôt actually hooked up properly!

We now have full plugin support for automagically creating collections for either your movies based on the Shoko Series
or all movies _and_ shows based on Shoko Groups. This can be used with the existing feature for using Shoko Groups to
create show entities, in addition to supporting the sub-groups feature in Shoko Server, which allows you to nest
multiple series into sub-groups. These groups and sub-groups will turn into nested collections in Jellyfin.

## Real-Time Sorcery with SignalR

SignalR is a library for ASP.NET developers that simplifies adding real-time web functionality to applications. Now, the
SignalR stream from Shoko Server can be used as an optional feature in the plugin. It can auto-connect on startup and
has customizable settings per media library and event group:

**File Events** can be used alongside real-time monitoring on the media library or replace it. These events are
triggered when a file already in the media library in Jellyfin, previously unrecognized (and thus not part of the
library), becomes recognized (and thus should be made part of the library). This is something that real-time monitoring
will not handle properly since there are no file events for when it happens.

**Refresh Events** can be configured to react to specific metadata refresh events sent from Shoko. This ensures your
metadata in Jellyfin is as up-to-date as possible with what is stored in Shoko Server, without needing to manually
refresh the entities.

## Enhanced Tags, Ratings, and Locations

The internals for processing tags have been overhauled. We now use a tag hierarchy to filter tags locally instead of the
filtering previously done on the Shoko Server side. This avoids magical numbers in code and gives us more control for
searching for tags in the hierarchy. Custom tag support has been revamped to support a _fake_ hierarchy using `/` (
forward slash) as a separator between levels in the tag name. Top-level custom tags without "child" tags are added to
the list if custom tags are enabled, while tags in the second level or below are treated as if they are part of the
AniDB hierarchy. With this new system, we now leverage AniDB tags and custom tags from Shoko Server more effectively.
Tags and genres on entities have been given better default settings, and we've added more granular controls for
overriding these defaults if needed. Feel free to tinker with the settings when you're bored. üòÑ

We've also introduced content ratings and production locations, providing more native features supported by the plugin!
Multiple sources for content ratings and production locations are already available in the settings, but support for
TMDB content ratings and production locations will arrive at a later date, after Shoko Server adds support for it. We've
already added the settings to the UI to prepare your library for when it does. üöÄ

### Content Ratings

Based on the tag hierarchy, we use the `/content indicators/*` and `/elements/*` tags to estimate the content rating for
seasons and series based
upon [this pdf available from the Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210720014648/https://www.tvguidelines.org/resources/TheRatings.pdf),
since the web site in question has since removed it from their site.

The content ratings we support are:

- `TV-G`
- `TV-Y`
- `TV-Y7` (Optionally with the `FV` indicator.)
- `TV-PG` (Optionally with `D`, `L`, `S`, and/or `V` indicators.)
- `TV-14` (Optionally with `D`, `L`, `S`, and/or `V` indicators.)
- `TV-MA` (Optionally with `L`, `S`, and/or `V` indicators.)
- `XXX` (Only for H content. üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è)

We also support overriding the content ratings using custom tags, by creating and using a tag conforming to the
following regular expression:

```txt
/^\/?target audience\/(?:tv[_\-]?)?(?:g|y|y7|pg|14|ma|xxx)(?:[_\-]?(fv|d|s|l|v){1,5})?$/i
```

And here are some example custom tags that will override the content rating to `TV-PG` for any series if applied in
Shoko:

- `target audience/TV-PG` ‚Üí `TV-PG`
- `Target Audience/TV-PG-DV` ‚Üí `TV-PG` + `D` & `V` indicators.
- `Target Audience/TV_PG_ld` ‚Üí `TV-PG` + `D` & `L` indicators.
- `/target audience/pgv` ‚Üí `TV-PG` + `V` indicator.
- `/TARGET AUDIENCE/TvPgSl` ‚Üí `TV-PG` + `L` & `S` indicators.

### Production Locations

Production locations are added based on the `/origin/*` tags in the tag hierarchy. This is a straightforward 1:N mapping
for relevant tags to production locations.

### Series Type Overrides

We also added support for manually overriding the series type of a Shoko series using custom tags. This can be useful,
for example, if you want to classify an AniDB movie series containing multiple movies as a _normal_ show in Jellyfin.
Use at your own discretion. üôÇ The tags are case-insensitive, and the trailing 's' and leading '/' are optional. Setting
multiple tags won't break anything, as it will only use the type from the first assigned tag. To set an override, assign
one of the following custom user tags:

- `series type/tv` ‚Üí `TV`
- `series type/tvspecial` ‚Üí `TVSpecial`
- `series type/tvspecials` ‚Üí `TVSpecial`
- `series type/tv special` ‚Üí `TVSpecial`
- `series type/tv specials` ‚Üí `TVSpecial`
- `series type/web` ‚Üí `Web`
- `/series type/movie` ‚Üí `Movie`
- `/series type/movies` ‚Üí `Movie`
- `/series type/ova` ‚Üí `OVA`
- `/series type/ovas` ‚Üí `OVA`
- `/series type/other` ‚Üí `Other`
- `/series type/others` ‚Üí `Other`

## What's Next?

**We're not done yet!**

There are still things to improve and new features to implement for the best possible experience. ~~Not to mention bugs
to squash‚Ä¶ ü´†~~ The new docs are coming, with more Shokofin documentation along with
it. [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) support is on the horizon in both Shoko Server and in the plugin ‚Äî which will
help address the "duplicate" images for movies within the same AniDB series entry, among other things in the plugin.
Looking forward, our future plans also include genre and tag providers, people providers, and more! Check out
the [To-Do list](https://github.com/orgs/ShokoAnime/projects/7) for more info if you're interested.
