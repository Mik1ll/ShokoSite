Welcome to the new Shoko Website!

While some members of our team have been working on fixing issues created by the move to .NET Standard, we also started
a side project to design and create a brand-new website for Shoko. Up until now, we've always used WordPress to run our
website. While it worked, there were definitely some limitations that became more apparent, especially with some of our
future plans. While we won't go into detail about those plans just yet, know that they involve allowing others to submit
content to the website. Only a few users had access to the website backend, and while we could have created accounts for
each user as needed, this would still require teaching every user how to use and update the specific WordPress plugins
and features we previously used.

So instead, we decided to completely drop WordPress and design and code our own site, and as you can see, **we did just
that**.

With our new website, both staff and users can make changes as needed, add new programs/plugins, and even create new
blog posts simply by creating a PR on the [site's repo](https://github.com/ShokoAnime/ShokoSite). You'll find some
information on what's required to submit a new program/plugin or create a blog post in the repo. The site doesn't update
automatically, but that's something we'll be looking into in the future.

## What Else Is New?

You mean besides the **brand-new site**?

- You've probably noticed the random page banner; it was something the staff liked from the WordPress site, so we
  included it.
- The front page will display a random plugin on load; keep refreshing to see them all!
- The individual program/plugin pages have been removed, with all the relevant information now shown on the **downloads
  ** page.
- The **About** page was actually finished, go check it out.

## How You Can Help

The site is brand new, and while we've had it up in a testing function for a couple of weeks, it's possible we missed
some bugs here and there. Users looking for an adventure should explore the site and report any issues found using
the [site's repo](https://github.com/ShokoAnime/ShokoSite) so we can fix them. We're also taking feedback, so feel free
to let us know what you think.

Also, before anyone asks, there is a **Dark Theme** in the works but no ETA.

## Known Issues

- There's an invalid breadcrumb on the pagination pages.
