After nearly five months and multiple designs and iterations, our new design for Shoko Docs is up! The main goal of this
update was to align the design with the updated homepage and to reevaluate the existing content, as much of the
information had become outdated or incorrect. To that end, most of the content was rewritten and condensed to make it
easier to follow and to reduce confusion for future contributors.

Take a look at the updated [Shoko Docs](https://docs.shokoanime.com/).

If you run across any issues or have any feedback, please let us know either on **Discord** or on
the [Shoko Docs GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ShokoAnime/ShokoDocs), so we can address it.

## Content Focused Design

One of the goals with the redesign was to make the content the primary focus. We've limited the content area width to
make it easier to read and ensured it is always centered, making it the main focus point. We also changed the content
layout and removed the column setup we were previously using, which led to confusion and squished images that were more
distracting than helpful.

## Translations

Like the website, a lot of work went into making Shoko Docs easily translatable. For the most part, as long as you know
English, you can translate Shoko Docs into another language.

Select the **Language** icon next to the **Theme** icon to see supported languages and to learn how to translate the
Shoko website. If you have any questions or need help, contact **EC** on **Discord**.

## Where Are The Docs For X?

During the update process, some older docs were intentionally left out, either because they no longer applied or due to
the time it would take to properly update them. This is not to say we don't plan to bring select pages back in the
future, but as an **open source** project, this is where we rely on the community to help fill in the gaps. If you
notice something is missing or incorrect, create a **PR** with the addition or fix.

## Where's That Upcoming Shoko News Blog Post?

If you're referring to the one in [Introducing Sushi.Net](https://shokoanime.com/blog/introducing-sushi.net/), don't
worry, we haven't forgotten about it. It was pushed back a bit as our next main goal is to get the next version of Shoko
released, which should be happening by the **end of January**. Expect our 2021 Shoko Roadmap blog post in early *
*February**.
