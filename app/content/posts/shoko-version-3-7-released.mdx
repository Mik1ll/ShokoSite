Hello Everyone,

While originally scheduled for earlier this month, Shoko Version 3.7 is finally available for download!

Version 3.7 is a big milestone for us for a variety of reasons that all share the same goal: to make Shoko even better
for both users and developers. Shoko is open-source for a reason; we want people to contribute, to implement new ideas,
fix bugs, or even optimize the code. We truly appreciate each and every person that has contributed to the project and
want to make it even easier to do so by addressing some of the issues that have been brought up. While we won't be going
into detail about these changes in this blog post, we do want to talk briefly about a few things you can expect from
Shoko in 2017.

**Users looking for Version 3.7.1.0 won't find it, we had to "trick" the update system as we used 3.7.0.100-899 for
dailies and 3.7.0.900-999 for beta. To address this problem we've introduced a new update channel system which you can
read about below.**

## Shoko Server Cross-Platform Support

We've already begun work on making Shoko Server cross-platform with the introduction of
the [Web UI](https://shokoanine.com/blog/introducing-the-jmm-server-webui/) and slowly
implementing [Nancy](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy), we hope to have Shoko Server cross-compatible in 2017. This in
itself will be a lot of work but we feel it's something that we can accomplish. Anyone that would like to help can
contact us on Discord for more information.

## Code Cleanup and Documentation

One of the main issues that's been reported from users wanting to contribute is the general lack of code documentation
within Shoko. This is something that will be addressed as we continue to implement and migrate to Nancy. We'll also be
able to remove deprecated and redundant code which should make the learning process much easier for newer users.

These are the main items we wanted to address but not everything we're working on or planning for Shoko in 2017, you'll
have to keep checking back to learn more. Before we get into what's new in Version 3.7, there are a few additional items
we'd like to address.

## Thank You Beta Testers

We'd like to thank everyone who participated in the 3.7 Beta. Without them this release would not have been possible for
at least another month at the minimum. This was our second public beta and like last time, the feedback we received
helped identify some otherwise hidden bugs and allowed us to make this release even better.

Some users asked if we could start hosting multiple betas in-between updates instead of towards the end and while it's a
good idea, it's just not feasible for us due to a number of reasons with two of the main reasons being the time and
maintenance required for this. However, **Avael** had been looking into automating builds to allow users to try the
latest commits which after some trial and error and lots of broken builds, we launched **Daily Builds** in November.

## Daily Builds

As a thank you to all our users, we now provide the ability for all users to try the latest builds of Shoko Server and
Shoko Desktop without having to build them yourself. Our **Daily Builds** are currently set up to build after each
commit and can be downloaded by checking the **Daily Build** section on our **Downloads** page. We're pretty active
on [GitHub](https://github.com/ShokoAnime/) and if you've been checking our commit logs you've probably noticed the *
*Build Indicators** after the commit time stamp as shown in the image below. If you're unsure if the latest commit has
built yet, the **Build Indicator** will tell you. You can also click it to view the build log if you'd like.

## Help Wanted!

We've got a lot of work coming up and are looking for users interested in contributing to Shoko in a variety of
different ways. If you'd like to help out please check the updated [Contributing](https://shokoanime.com) page or get in
contact with us on Discord. We're looking for users for a number of different roles so just because you can't code
doesn't mean you can't help out.

## Version 3.7

As usual, head on over to the [changelog](https://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog) for a complete listing of all changes
made in version 3.7.

## Cloud Support

Shoko now officially supports cloud hosting meaning you no longer have to map the cloud folder using NetDrive or a
similar program. You can now directly add a supported cloud provider and map the actual cloud folder for use with Shoko.
We currently support the following cloud providers, we will only be adding additional cloud providers if the demand for
them is high. If you'd like to add support for a particular cloud provider, contact us on Discord.

- Amazon
- Google Drive
- One Drive

Please note, not all supported cloud providers offer the same speeds and service. Please read the
updated [Configuring Shoko Server](https://docs.shokoanime.com/server/config) page for instructions on how to use a
cloud provider.

## MPV Integration, Zoom Player Support and Video Player Changes

After having to constantly fix the previously supported video players with almost every release due to something we
changed or an update to the video player itself **we're no longer offering full integration** for video players that *
*do not have a Web UI option**. It's a lot of work and testing that can be better used elsewhere, not to mention you
needed to run Shoko as an administrator to even be able to use the previous .INI solution. Video Players are now broken
into two different groups, **Supported Players** and **Limited Players**, supported players will be able to take
advantage of all video player integration while limited players are only guaranteed for file playback.

The following players have full support.

- Internal MPV
- MPC
- Zoom Player

The following players have limited support.

- VLC
- Pot Player
- External MPV
- Windows Default

Users can now use Shoko Player, our built-in player that's powered by MPV!

MPV is one of the best video players available that is lightweight, designed for maximum performance and supports a wide
range of file formats. Plex users already know this as
Plex [hired the main developer of MPV](https://www.plex.tv/blog/introducing-the-plex-media-player/) and used MPV as the
base for Plex Media Player. Shoko Player is still being developed and worked on and is only controllable using the 1-9
keys. We're working on adding a GUI and additional features.

While not originally part of the plan, Zoom Player support has also been added thanks to **Netsplite** giving users
another media player to use with Shoko.

## Web UI Included

We want everyone to become familiar with the Web UI as it will eventually take the place of the existing Shoko Server UI
when Shoko Server is fully cross-compatible. You can access the Web UI by typing in **localhost:8111** in your browser
after Shoko Server has finished loading. The login is the Shoko user account which by default is **Default** for the
username, there is no password. User feedback is highly encouraged as we'll be making a lot of changes to how it looks
and runs as we progress forward. Please report back issues or suggestions you might have in
the [Web UI Repository](https://github.com/ShokoAnime/ShokoServer-WebUI) on GitHub.

## Administrative Privileges No Longer Needed

Both Shoko Server and Shoko Desktop will now keep all related files in the ProgramData folder. You'll need to run both
Shoko Server and Shoko Desktop as an administrator once for everything to be set up properly. Existing users will have
all their files automatically moved. After the initial run as an administrator you'll be able to run Shoko as a normal
user, we've done a lot of testing but everyone's setup is different so if you encounter any problems please contact us
on Discord so we can help.

## Shoko Server Integrity Check

We've added a new utility to Shoko Server that allows users to run an integrity check on their entire collection. If
ran, each file is rehashed and has its new hash compared to the hash stored in the database from when the file was
originally imported. If the hash is different, Shoko Server will report the file as corrupted allowing users to easily
replace corrupted files.

## Update Channels Added

Users can now check different update channels, Stable and Beta, and switch between them with ease. The channel can be
selected in the **About** window, with the desired channel selected click the **Check For Updates** button. This was a
last-minute addition we added due to the confusion some users had during the beta which caused fixed issues to be
reported, we'll be fine-tuning as well as looking into adding a daily channel as we go forward.

## AniDB Dynamic Rate Limiter

To enhance our AniDB ban prevention system, Shoko now considers user intervention during AniDB requests. Previously,
users could bypass our ban prevention method by pausing the queue and waiting or restarting Shoko Server. This created
issues for users who paused or cleared the AniDB queue for various reasons, including those adding to their collection
incrementally. The improved system now tracks total usage and throttles as needed to prevent AniDB bans.

Please note, **there is currently an issue with users receiving an HTTP ban from AniDB**, which is different from a UDP
ban that our AniDB ban prevention system addresses. This issue appears to be on AniDB's side and is being investigated.

## Log Rotator

We've implemented a Log Rotator that will zip up old log files to reduce the size of the log folder. Currently, it's
hard-coded to do this every day, but we'll be adding options for users to select different frequencies and decide what
to do with older logs. Suggestions for improving this system are welcome.

## My Anime 3 and the Future

Version 3.6 introduced significant changes that caused issues with My Anime 3. With the addition of **Netsplite** to the
team, we not only restored functionality but also fixed longstanding bugs and added new features. Version 3.7 has
brought many changes to My Anime 3. Except for a few user-specific bugs, we've resolved all remaining issues. While some
feature improvements or additions are still pending, we will be focusing our resources and time on other projects in the
Shoko suite. This does not mean we are discontinuing or stopping support for My Anime 3; it just means it is now largely
complete. We are currently following the development of Media Portal 2 but have no announcements regarding support for
it at this time.

We also want to thank [pur_berger](http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/members/pur_berger.50701/) for allowing us to
include his modifications to the Avallanche skin, enabling My Anime 3 to work with it.

## Known Issues

- Some utilities do not work with files hosted on the cloud.
- If a video player is already open, there is a chance that video playback will fail when the user presses the play
  button.
