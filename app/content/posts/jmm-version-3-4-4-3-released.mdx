yourself with what's changed.

## Metro Dashboard

The series display in the Metro dashboard has received a few small tweaks.

* A button has been added to refresh this series.
* The previous episode you watched is now shown, so you can re-watch it easily, or just in case you accidentally marked
  it as watched.
* The next episode to watch is highlighted and shows a few more details than other episodes.

## Trakt

The major focus of this release has been adding support for Version 2.0 of the Trakt API. For the last 6-9 months, this
has been broken in JMM. Most of this is invisible to the user, but a few things will be different and are detailed
below. Trakt now uses OAuth to verify your credentials, and you are no longer required to enter your login/password into
JMM. Once Trakt is enabled, simply click on the "Get PIN" link, and this will re-direct you to the Trakt website, and
you will be given a temporary PIN as shown below.

Copy and paste this PIN into the text box in JMM Desktop, and then hit "Authorize JMM". At this point, JMM stores a
token which it can use to start sending data to Trakt. Since Trakt has not been working for such a long time, you will
probably find that a lot of your Trakt data is not valid anymore.

## Community Data

A new utility has been added to help fix this data.

Step 1 - Select the first 2 checkboxes and Press Start. This will check with Trakt that your existing data is correct;
if it is not, it will be removed from your local database.

Step 2 - Uncheck the first 2 checkboxes and select the third "Check if my links are different from Community
Recommendations". This will check the links you have selected against what the admins have selected as the correct
links. You can then filter the list to see what series are missing a link entirely or differ from the recommendation.

**NOTE:** This can take quite a while depending on the number of series you have. It also has the benefit of updating
your existing data.

From here you can open the series to fix the data manually.

Click on the button to search, and it will show you the community recommendation, and you can use this instead.
