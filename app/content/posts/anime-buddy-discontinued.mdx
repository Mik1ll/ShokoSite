We have received numerous inquiries about the development status of Anime Buddy in the last few months. Initially, we
intended to continue updating the software, but several issues have made it nearly impossible for us to do so without
creating a completely new program. Anime Buddy has not received any updates in years, and with the significant changes
we've implemented in recent versions, we would need to rewrite the entire program to make it functional again.

However, the most significant obstacle is that we do not have access to the Windows Store, meaning that current Anime
Buddy users would not be able to update to a newer version. While we had previously discussed the possibility of
creating a successor in the form of a smartphone app, we currently have no plans to pursue this option.

As a result, we have updated the Anime Buddy product page to reflect this announcement. While all resources will remain
available for now, they will eventually be removed.

We would like to express our gratitude to everyone who has used Anime Buddy over the years!
