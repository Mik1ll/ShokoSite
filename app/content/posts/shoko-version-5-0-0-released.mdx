After over a year in development, we are excited to announce the release of **Shoko Version 5.0.0**! This release is,
without a doubt, the biggest we've had in a long time, packed with numerous new features, improvements, and bug fixes.
We've worked tirelessly to make Shoko better than ever, and we can't wait to share all the exciting changes with you.

For a comprehensive list of all the changes in this release, please visit
our [Changelog](https://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog/shoko-server). We highly recommend reviewing it to explore all the
new features and improvements in detail. Below, we've highlighted some of the major changes.

## Why The Long Wait?

In the past, we've mentioned our intention to release updates more frequently. However, the primary focus of this
release was to replace the [TVDB](https://www.thetvdb.com) metadata integration
with [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US). Although we had some limited support for TMDB before, it was
never fully implemented. As work on this feature progressed, development on the Web UI accelerated as well, expanding
the scope of this release from just TMDB support to a complete overhaul of the Web UI.

## New Web UI

One of the most significant changes in this release is the brand-new, improved Web UI. It now offers near feature parity
with Shoko Desktop, allowing users to manage nearly every aspect of their collection directly from the Web UI.
Initially, this wasn’t planned for this release, but as the scope grew and more time was dedicated to the Web UI, it
became clear that achieving feature parity with Shoko Desktop was essential.

Beyond feature parity, the Web UI has been redesigned for better usability and smoother navigation. We took the time to
gather user feedback and incorporated it into the new design. While there’s always room for improvement, we encourage
you to share your thoughts or suggestions. Since the Web UI can now be released independently of Shoko Server, users can
enjoy new features and updates without waiting for a server release.

We **strongly** recommend checking out the [Redesigned Shoko Docs](https://docs.shokoanime.com). These docs are
specifically designed for the new Web UI and will help you get started, understand the latest features, and even
discover some cool additions, like **theme support**.

### How to Upgrade the Web UI

To upgrade to the new Web UI, follow these steps:

- Open settings in the Web UI.
- Change the Web UI update channel to "stable" (if it’s not already set to that).
- Click on "update available" to start the update.
- After the update, the Web UI will log you out, but it will still display the old login page.
- Open the Web UI in a new tab to access the new interface.

## Queue Processor

Improving the old queue system has been a long-standing task. The previous system only supported three specific workers,
with one task running per worker. Often, this led to only one worker being active at a time since the other tasks were
tied to that worker, causing delays in queue processing.

The new Queue Processor is a complete rewrite of the old system. It removes the worker limitation, now supporting
multiple workers, with the number of workers depending on your setup. It also allows for task prioritization, which
Shoko automatically handles. This improvement has significantly sped up queue processing by ensuring tasks that could
cause bottlenecks no longer block the entire queue. If Shoko encounters tasks with external dependencies that delay
processing, the Queue Processor will automatically reallocate workers to other tasks, ensuring smooth and efficient
queue progression.

## TMDB Support

We’ve been discussing full TMDB support since
our [Shoko 2021 Project Update](https://shokoanime.com/blog/shoko-2021-project-update/). After months of work and
testing, we are thrilled to announce that Shoko now fully supports TMDB metadata for both series and movies! Similar to
the old TVDB linking system, Shoko will automatically attempt to link your series and movies to TMDB. In cases where
automatic linking fails, a fallback system allows users to manually link the data.

The TMDB integration supports one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-one relationships, providing more flexibility when
handling discrepancies between AniDB and TMDB data.

## Shoko Desktop Improvements

While the Web UI is intended to be the primary way to interact with Shoko going forward, we understand that some users
still prefer using Shoko Desktop. In the past, we mentioned that support for Shoko Desktop would eventually be dropped,
and we even labeled it a legacy application. Although we’ve implemented a few fixes for Shoko Desktop in this release,
we still encourage users to switch to the Web UI. Full support for Shoko Desktop will be discontinued in the near
future.
