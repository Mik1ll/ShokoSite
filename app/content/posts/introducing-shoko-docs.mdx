We're Back!

This past weekend we moved everything over to our **ShokoAnime** domain name, making it our primary domain name and
switching to more reliable hosts. You may have noticed some changes around the site. During the downtime, the site went
through intensive maintenance, stripping away anything that was causing performance issues. We also decided to go for a
less resource-intensive theme that's sleeker, and for those of you visiting us on mobile, it looks great.

Now onto the main purpose of this blog post.

## Introducing Shoko Docs

Anyone who's visited our GitHub repo in the past couple of months or talked with us on Discord has probably noticed we'
ve been making a lot of core changes to Shoko. We've talked about some of these changes before with our vision for Shoko
going forward. We made our previously private ClientV2 channel accessible to all users on our Discord server, and now
we're opening up Shoko Docs.

Shoko Docs will be our hub for everything related to documentation when it comes to Shoko. We've previously hosted the
documentation on the site, but with so many other projects in the works, it often went untouched for long periods of
time. With that being said, you're probably wondering how Shoko Docs will be any different, and that's a valid point.
Our hope is that you, the users, will help make a difference.

We're bringing the power of crowd-sourcing to Shoko Docs by
completely [hosting it on GitHub](https://github.com/ShokoAnime/ShokoDocs) and allowing anyone who wants to contribute
to do just that. We wanted Shoko Docs to be accessible to as many people as possible and decided that using GitHub to
host it would make that possible. Shoko Docs is written in HTML, CSS, and JS and built with Bootstrap 3.3.7, just like
the Shoko Server Web UI.

You can reach Shoko Docs either by clicking on Shoko Docs in the menu above or using the link below.

## Rewritten From Scratch

While a lot of the old documentation will still be used as an outline, Shoko Docs is being rewritten from scratch so
that the content being presented is accurate and up-to-date, as previously there were sections that had not been touched
in over a year. This means that previously available pages are currently not available. We have created a priority list
starting with Shoko Server but are open to suggestions on what should be worked on first.

As usual, feel free to message us on Discord if you have any questions.
