As many of you have probably already heard, Kyoto Animation, creators of such anime as Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and A Silent Voice, suffered a horrific arson attack yesterday that killed 33 people, with many more injured. This is the largest terror attack in Japan since 2001, and it obviously extends far beyond the anime community.

American licensing company [Sentai Filmworks](https://www.sentaifilmworks.com/) has created a GoFundMe that we encourage all anime fans to donate to help those affected by this tragic event. You can donate and find more information on the [Support Kyoto Animation](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-kyoani-heal) GoFundMe page.
