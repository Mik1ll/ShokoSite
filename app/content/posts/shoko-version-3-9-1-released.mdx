Shoko Version 3.9.1 is now available for download!

We've made a few visual changes to the TvDB Linking system, but beyond that, this is mostly a maintenance release
addressing some issues that were discovered when attempting to update your AniDB MyList.

For a complete list of changes, check out the [Changelog](https://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog.html).

Unless there are any major issues discovered after this release, this will be the last release in the 3.9.X series as
we'll be working on some major changes going forward. The next major version, version 4.0.0, will see a lot of
under-the-hood improvements that will benefit all users in the long run. We'll be dropping nhibernate and replacing it
with EF, dropping Nancy for ASP.NET, and arguably the biggest change, moving to the newer .NET standard framework, which
will allow better cross-platform compatibility. These upcoming changes will require extensive testing, so don't expect a
stable release for a couple of months. However, if you'd like to help out with developing or testing, jump on Discord
and contact a staff member.
