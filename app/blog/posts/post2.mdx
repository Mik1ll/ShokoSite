# First Post

After being in development for quite some time, we're happy to announce our [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) plugin is now available to all users. We've previously [talked about Shokofin](https://shokoanime.com/blog/shoko-2021-roadmap/) before and with a starting version of 1.4.7, some of you might be wondering why it took so long for us to announce it.

Originally we had to wait for Jellyfin version 10.7 to be released, as we heavily relied on a change introduced in that version and didn't want to make people install a dev version that could potentially cause damage to their database. We also wanted to do some additional work before officially launching Shokofin and like all are other planned changes, time became our biggest enemy pushing the release back.

##### So tell me, what is Shokofin?
