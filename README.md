# Overview
This repository is for the [Shoko Website](https://shokoanime.com), which provides news and information about the Shoko suite of programs and plugins.

# Adding New Content
Anyone working on a project that utilizes Shoko is more than welcome to create news posts about said project and/or add it to the available list of programs/plugins for download on the site. Please note, we typically do not allow project announcement-like posts and usually require, at the very minimum, an MVP of the project.

## Blog Posts
Blog posts are MDX files written in Markdown and are located in the `routes/blog/posts` directory. Please see an existing blog post for structure and formatting.

## Downloadable Programs/Plugins
Downloads are kept in a JSON file in the `public/data` directory. Please see an existing entry for structure and formatting.

# Pull Requests Welcome!
If you've found a mistake or think something can be worded better, submit a pull request! We use dPrint and ESLint to ensure consistency and quality in our codebase, so make sure you have these plugins installed and enabled in your IDE.

# Getting Assistance
We're more than happy to help. Simply message **Elemental Crisis** on Discord.
